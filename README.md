# Emotion-Image-Recongition-Machine-Learning-Project

The dataset, FER-2013, was sourced from Kaggle, consisting of 48x48 greyscale images
of faces with different facial expressions. The images were already preprocessed so that
each face is roughly in the center of the screen, and occupies similar amounts of space in
each image. The objective was to categorize each image into different types of emotions. The images
were given to us in seven different categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise,
and neutral (The training set had over 28,000 examples and the test set had over 3,500
examples).

Three methods were used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks.
